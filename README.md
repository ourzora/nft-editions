### Deprecation Notice

This is a legacy NFT protocol which ZORA does not use anymore but is still alive onchain due to the nature of decentralized applications.

The media onchain is supported by multiple NFT platforms (including ZORA) for historical purposes, trading, and display but we strongly recommend using other approaches to mint and sell NFTs today (including our newer https://github.com/ourzora/zora-protocol protocol monorepo).


# Zora NFT Editions

### What are these contracts?
1. `SingleEditionMintable`
   Each edition is a unique contract.
   This allows for easy royalty collection, clear ownership of the collection, and your own contract ðŸŽ‰
2. `SingleEditionMintableCreator`
   Gas-optimized factory contract allowing you to easily + for a low gas transaction create your own edition mintable contract.
3. `SharedNFTLogic`
   Contract that includes dynamic metadata generation for your editions removing the need for a centralized server.
   imageUrl and animationUrl can be base64-encoded data-uris for these contracts totally removing the need for IPFS

### How do I create a new contract?

### Directly on the blockchain:
1. Find/Deploy the `SingleEditionMintableCreator` contract
2. Call `createEdition` on the `SingleEditionMintableCreator`

### How do I create a new edition?

call `createEdition` with the given arguments to create a new editions contract:

- Name: Token Name Symbol (shows in etherscan)
- Symbol: Symbol of the Token (shows in etherscan)
- Description: Description of the Token (shows in the NFT description)
- Animation URL: IPFS/Arweave URL of the animation (video, webpage, audio, etc)
- Animation Hash: sha-256 hash of the animation, 0x0 if no animation url provided
- Image URL: IPFS/Arweave URL of the image (image/, gifs are good for previewing images)
- Image Hash: sha-256 hash of the image, 0x0 if no image url provided
- Edition Size: Number of this edition, if set to 0 edition is not capped/limited
- BPS Royalty: 500 = 5%, 1000 = 10%, so on and so forth, set to 0 for no on-chain royalty (not supported by all marketplaces)

### How do I sell/distribute editions?

Now that you have a edition, there are multiple options for lazy-minting and sales:

1. To sell editions for ETH you can call `setSalePrice`
2. To allow certain accounts to mint `setApprovedMinter(address, approved)`.
3. To mint yourself to a list of addresses you can call `mintEditions(addresses[])` to mint an edition to each address in the list.

### Benefits of these contracts:

* Full ownership of your own created minting contract
* Each serial gets its own minting contract
* Gas-optimized over creating individual NFTs
* Fully compatible with ERC721 marketplaces / auction houses / tools
* Supports tracking unique parts (edition 1 vs 24 may have different pricing implications) of editions
* Supports free public minting (by approving the 0x0 (zeroaddress) to mint)
* Supports smart-contract based minting (by approving the custom minting smart contract) using an interface.
* All metadata is stored/generated on-chain -- only image/video assets are stored off-chain
* Permissionless and open-source
* Simple integrated ethereum-based sales, can be easily extended with custom interface code

### Potential use cases for these contracts:

* Giveaways for events showing if youâ€™ve attended 
* Serial editioned artworks that can be sold in the Zora auction house / work in any ERC721 market
* Fundraisers for fixed-eth amounts
* Can be used to issue tokens in response for contributing to a fundraiser
* Tickets/access tokens allowing holders to access a discord or mint

### Deploying:
